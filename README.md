# Chess.comEmojis

## Add some more ðŸ’©EmojisðŸ’© to Chess.com Chat Function

So basically, in a Chess.com Livestream, Livegame or daily game, you only have these boring Emojis for the chat section:

Since we can paste Unicode in the Textarea (where blabla is written), you can paste ALL UNICODE EMOJIS that there are.

So this script adds a little dropdown menu to your usual text chat:

When you open it, you'll be presented with a selection of additional non standard Emojis you can post:

Just select one, and  **HIT SPACE in the textarea after inserting it**. Then hit Enter and it will post. 
I don't know why it needs the space (or some other key) behind it, maybe an Event Listener somewhere waiting for keystrokes.
Just hit space and it works. :)

## Additional Resources

Here's a complete List of [ALL UNICODE EMOJIYS](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-style.txt) so you can edit the script to your liking.

There are several possibilities to run it:
