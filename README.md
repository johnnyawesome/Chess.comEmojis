# Chess.comEmojis

## Bugreport / Disclaimer
   
   So I don't know if this is a bug or intended. The only thing you do, is posting a Unicode-Emoji. (An Emoji you would even have on your standard onscreen keyboard if you would open the site on your cellphone), but to be sure, I filed a Bugreport with chess.com well before posting this script. It can be found here: https://www.chess.com/forum/view/help-support/abusing-the-comment-function-on-chess-com
   
   **Again: this is nothing fancy or forbidden. They ALLOW Unicode in the chat.
   It's just that your normal hardware-keyboard can't type Unicode, but ASCII.
   Visit the same site on your cellphone, click the emoji button on the onscreen-keyboard, and you can use all Unicode Emojis without this script.**
   
   **This script only enables your Desktop/Laptop to do the SAME thing your cellphone has been able to do for YEARS.**

## Add some more ðŸ’©EmojisðŸ’© to Chess.com Chat Function

So basically, in a Chess.com Livestream, you only have these Emojis for the chat section:

Since we can paste Unicode in the Textarea (where blabla is written), you can paste ALL UNICODE EMOJIS that there are.

So this script adds a little dropdown to your usual text chat:

When you open it, you'll be presented with a selection of additional non standard Emojis you can post:

Just select one, and  **HIT SPACE in the textarea after inserting it**. Then hit Enter and it will post. 
I don't know why it needs the space (or some other key) behind it, maybe an Event Listener somewhere waiting for keystrokes.
Just hit space and it works. :)

## Additional Resources

Here's a complete List of [ALL UNICODE EMOJIYS](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-style.txt) so you can edit the script to your liking.

## How to run the script

There are several possibilities to run it:

 - Greasemonkey in Firefox
 - It even works from Firefoxes Scratchpad if you don't want to install the Plugin.
