# Chess.comEmojis

## Adds some more Emojis to Chess.com Livestream

So basically, in a Chess.com Livestream, you only have these Emojis:

Since we can paste Unicode in the Textarea (where blabla is written), you can paste ALL UNICODE EMOJIS that there are.

So this script adds a little dropdown to your usual text chat:

When you open it, you'll be presented with a selection of Non-Sanctioned Emojis you can post:

Just select one, and  **HIT SPACE in the textarea after inserting it**. Then hit Enter and it will post. 
I don't know why it needs the space, maybe an Event Listener somewhere waiting for keystrokes.
